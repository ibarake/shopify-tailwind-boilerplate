# üé® Shopify Tailwind Theme Boilerplate

This boilerplate is designed to kickstart your Shopify theme development using Tailwind CSS. It combines the power of Shopify's theming capabilities with the flexibility and utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS, allowing you to create stunning, responsive, and high-performance eCommerce websites with ease.

## üöÄ Installation

To get started with this boilerplate, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, you can follow the steps below to set up your development environment.

1. **Clone the repository**

   First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ibarake/shopify-tailwind-boilerplate.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   Navigate into your new project's directory and install its dependencies using npm.

## üîß Working with Shopify CLI

To develop and test your theme directly on a Shopify store, you'll need to use the Shopify CLI. Make sure you have the Shopify CLI installed and authenticated with your Shopify account. Here's how you can start working with your theme on Shopify.

1. **Initialize your theme on Shopify**

   Use the Shopify CLI to initialize your theme locally. This will link your local theme development environment with your Shopify store.

   ```bash
   shopify theme dev -s [store-link]
   ```

2. **When making changes to your local customize remember to PULL**

   Everytime you make changes in your local customize, changes will not reflect until you pull those changed settings.

   ```bash
   shopify theme pull -t [local-theme-id]
   ```

3. **when making done with your changes**

    When wanting to push your changes, use this same repo to push.

4. **Connect your repo to shopify**

    When wanting to deliver to the client, you need to connect the main branch of the repo to the shopify store to deliver. `.shopifyignore` will take care of the building files.
